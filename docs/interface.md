# Navigating through the Covid Information Site
Welcome to the Covid Information Site! Here we provide a simple guide to navigate you
through our website. Our website includes a home page, an information page, and one last
subscription page so that users can subscribe and receive updates and new information
from the website. All of these pages can be found at the top right of the interface
for the website.

## Home Page
At the top of the home page, you will find a quick introduction to our website that 
includes a News button and a Learn More button. The News button directs you to three different
news outlets further down the page: New York Times, CNN, and John's Hopkins Covid Resource Center.
The Learn More button takes you to the Information page. Alongside these two buttons, there is an
embedded Twitter feed that receives updates from the official CDC Twitter account. If you scroll down 
to the middle of the home page you will find the John's Hopkins COVID Global Information System. This
is an embedded system that gives updated information on confirmed cases and deaths to a county level
in the United States. It includes statistics, graphs, and maps pertaining to the data, additionally it
is updated on a daily basis. Lastly, towards the bottom of the home page you will find the additional news
networks as mentioned before. These will direct you to the appropriate external news sites that provide
information on Covid-19.

## Information Page
The information page provides brief information on how to prevent the spread of Covid-19 through masks
and Covid testing. Under the section pertaining to wearing masks, we have listed a few notable points 
made by the CDC when it comes to wearing masks and why those guidelines should be followed. Under the 
section pertaining to Covid testing, there are a few bullet points regarding types of Covid testing
and why we should get Covid tested. If you scroll down, at the middle of the page there is a section
about positivity rates in local areas such as Chapel Hill and Durham. This section is currently under
development. At the bottom of the page, you will find all of the contributors to the Covid Information
Site.
