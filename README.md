## Summary 

A three-page information dashboard focusing on up-to-date Covid-19 statistics and current medical advice.

An information page gives general advise for covid protocols, testing, and masking. Although not completed this page also has been set up to highlight covid positivity rates in local areas, and information about the development team. The final page consists of a form for visitors to sign up for a subscription to a newsletter that would provide updates on covid statistics and guidelines as they change.
